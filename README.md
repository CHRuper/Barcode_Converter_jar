# Barcode_Converter_jar
this simple local program was made for convert inputing barcode to another that can be read in my work platform
Example:
somebody from team scanned barcodes(watch input.txt file) and send you, but you can't work on it in your job platform.
But if you will convert barcode (like in output.txt file) everything will work.
